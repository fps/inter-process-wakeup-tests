# Notes


## chrt
Do not forget to use e.g. `chrt` to enable `SCHED_FIFO`. E.g.:

```
chrt -f 95 ./i_cond_shm 
```

```
chrt -f 95 ./o_cond_shm
```

## Named pipes

for the `i_pipe` and `o_pipe` programs you need to create a named pipe with e.g.

```
mkfifo pipe
```

And then running

```
chrt -f 95 ./i_pipe pipe
```

and 

```
chrt -f 95 ./o_pipe pipe
```

## Condition variable in SHM

You have to run the `i_cond_shm` before `o_cond_shm` because the former initializes the mutex and condition variable in the shared memory.
